# Acceptance tests

`python3 tests/validate-template.py` checks the public installation contract.
The image build runs upstream's stdio, loopback binding, rendering, scene
integrity and durability tests, plus both TypeScript checks.

The live test edits **an empty dedicated test canvas**. It uses a real browser
and real MCP over `docker exec -i`, verifies the browser scene after live
create/update/delete messages, and restarts Docker to compare the full scene,
binary file and snapshot responses. Use synthetic content only. It creates
local screenshots and `evidence/acceptance.json`; these are ignored by Git.

Install `cloakbrowser` and `playwright-core` in your test environment. With an
existing SSH tunnel to a dedicated remote test instance:

```sh
ACCEPTANCE_TEST_CANVAS=1 SSH_HOST=your-unraid-ssh-host \
CANVAS_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3031 TEST_CONTAINER=excalidraw-live \
node tests/live-acceptance.mjs
```

`BROWSER_MODULE` can point to an existing CloakBrowser ES module installation.
The normal package lookup works if installed locally. The test does not create
SSH credentials or register MCP in a user's client configuration.

For a real Unraid install-path test, pass the XML to the **installed** Docker
Manager `xmlToCommand` function and execute its generated create command for
the dedicated new service. Assert it produces one loopback port mapping, the
intended `/data` bind, non-root/read-only settings and correct image. Then run
the live test. Do not simulate installation with a hand-written Docker command
and call that a Docker Manager template test.
